# morphological-filter-ip-core
this is an hdl morphological filter ip core. The ip core was generated using Vivado HLS and was implemented on the zynq 7000 soc. The linux kernel driver for the ip core is in my linux kernel tree (under drivers/uio/uio_xmorphfilter.c). The filter is used in my rt-depth-map project (unter wafgo/rt-depth-map) to accelerate the video processing pipeline
